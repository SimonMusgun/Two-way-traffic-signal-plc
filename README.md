# Two-Way Traffic Signal using PLC (RSLogix Micro)

## Overview

This project implements a two-way traffic signal system using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and RSLogix Micro programming software. The system simulates a simple intersection with traffic lights controlling two directions of traffic.

## Features

- **Traffic Signal Control:** Efficiently manages the traffic flow with red, yellow, and green signals for both directions.
- **PLC Logic:** Utilizes RSLogix Micro for programming the PLC logic to control the traffic signal timings.
- **Simulation Mode:** Allows for simulation of the traffic signal system without the need for physical hardware.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- RSLogix Micro programming software installed.
- Appropriate PLC hardware or simulator for testing.
